A simple script for running calculations on 3commas grid bots.

# Installation

Clone the repository, open the folder, then run:

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

Currently, this only supports a rough average buy calculator for grid bots, allowing you to more easily switch from a grid bot to a smart trade.

```bash
node calc-average-buy.js --id {id}
```

Replace `{id}` with the grid bot ID number from 3commas
